# Connect-4

This repository contains my attempt at making a Connect 4 AI. It uses alpha beta pruning, but it is still quite slow and the heuristic just looks at the number of 3-in-a-rows and broken 3-in-a-rows, which apparently does not perform that well.

## Running the program

To play the game simply run Connect4Game.py with `python3 Connect4Game.py`. It just runs in the command line, giving the computer an edge because the board is so hard to read.
